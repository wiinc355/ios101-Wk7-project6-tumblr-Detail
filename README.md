# Project 6 - Tumblr Detail

Submitted by: Derrick Woodall

Tumblr Detail is an iOS app that fetches photo blog posts from the Humans of New York Tumblr blog using the Tumblr API. It 
displays a list of post summaries with images in a table view. When a user taps on a post, it navigates to a detail screen showing 
a larger version of the image and the full post caption, styled from HTML. The app demonstrates table view navigation, data 
passing between view controllers, and basic UI styling.
